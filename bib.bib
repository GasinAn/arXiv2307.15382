  abstract     = {Fundamental constants are a cornerstone of our physical laws. Any constant varying in space and/or time would reflect the existence of an almost massless field that couples to matter. This will induce a violation of the universality of free fall. Thus, it is of utmost importance for our understanding of gravity and of the domain of validity of general relativity to test for their constancy. We detail the relations between the constants, the tests of the local position invariance and of the universality of free fall. We then review the main experimental and observational constraints that have been obtained from atomic clocks, the Oklo phenomenon, solar system observations, meteorite dating, quasar absorption spectra, stellar physics, pulsar timing, the cosmic microwave background and big bang nucleosynthesis. At each step we describe the basics of each system, its dependence with respect to the constants, the known systematic effects and the most recent constraints that have been obtained. We then describe the main theoretical frameworks in which the low-energy constants may actually be varying and we focus on the unification mechanisms and the relations between the variation of different constants. To finish, we discuss the more speculative possibility of understanding their numerical values and the apparent fine-tuning that they confront us with.},

  abstract     = {Space-borne gravitational wave detectors, such as the proposed Laser         Interferometer Space Antenna, are expected to observe black hole         coalescences to high redshift and with large signal-to-noise         ratios, rendering their gravitational waves ideal probes of         fundamental physics. The promotion of Newton{\textquoteright}s         constant to a time function introduces modifications to the         binary{\textquoteright}s binding energy and the gravitational         wave luminosity, leading to corrections in the chirping         frequency. Such corrections propagate into the response function         and, given a gravitational wave observation, they allow for         constraints on the first time derivative of         Newton{\textquoteright}s constant at the time of merger. We find         that space-borne detectors could indeed place interesting         constraints on this quantity as a function of sky position and         redshift, providing a constraint map over the entire range of         redshifts where binary black hole mergers are expected to occur.         A gravitational wave observation of an inspiral event with         redshifted masses of {}10$^{4}$-{}10$^{5}$ solar masses for         three years should be able to measure GË™/G at the time of merger         to better than 10$^{-11}$yr$^{-1}$.},

  abstract     = {On 2017 August 17, the gravitational-wave event GW170817 was observed by         the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, and the gamma-ray burst         (GRB) GRB 170817A was observed independently by the Fermi Gamma-         ray Burst Monitor, and the Anti-Coincidence Shield for the         Spectrometer for the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics         Laboratory. The probability of the near-simultaneous temporal         and spatial observation of GRB 170817A and GW170817 occurring by         chance is 5.0{\texttimes} \{10\}$^{-8}$. We therefore confirm         binary neutron star mergers as a progenitor of short GRBs. The         association of GW170817 and GRB 170817A provides new insight         into fundamental physics and the origin of short GRBs. We use         the observed time delay of (+1.74+/- 0.05) \{\{s\}\} between GRB         170817A and GW170817 to: (I) constrain the difference between         the speed of gravity and the speed of light to be between         -3{\texttimes} \{10\}$^{-15}$ and +7{\texttimes} \{10\}$^{-16}$         times the speed of light, (II) place new bounds on the violation         of Lorentz invariance, (III) present a new test of the         equivalence principle by constraining the Shapiro delay between         gravitational and electromagnetic radiation. We also use the         time delay to constrain the size and bulk Lorentz factor of the         region emitting the gamma-rays. GRB 170817A is the closest short         GRB with a known distance, but is between 2 and 6 orders of         magnitude less energetic than other bursts with measured         redshift. A new generation of gamma-ray detectors, and         subthreshold searches in existing detectors, will be essential         to detect similar short bursts at greater distances. Finally, we         predict a joint detection rate for the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst         Monitor and the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors of 0.1-1.4 per         year during the 2018-2019 observing run and 0.3-1.7 per year at         design sensitivity.},
